# All My Etherpads

Etherpads are awesome, but they have a few problems:

* There's no easy way to keep track of all your Etherpads, especially across
  multiple servers.

* Sometimes an Etherpad server goes down.

* Accessing an Etherpad on a mobile device isn't fun because the site loads
  very slowly.

[All My Etherpads][] is a simple mobile Web app that solves these problems by
storing HTML versions of your Etherpads for offline viewing.
